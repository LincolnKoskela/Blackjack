# Blackjack (Java)
Welcome to the Blackjack project — a game that's going to be more than just the usual. 
This app will eventually teach players real casino strategy, optimal decision making, 
and even a full **card counting simulator** to help turn any player into an advantage-playing magician.

I surely can't perfectly recreate the adrenaline of sitting across from the dealer with cameras watching you
and mucho money on the line. But I *can* give you the next best thing through a clean UI, realistic gameplay, 
and strategy tools, designed to tilt the odds back in our favor.

## Current State of Game
Work in progress. Building engine.

## Project Management
You can view my current development progress out here:


## Blackjack Architecture
| **Class** | **Responsibility** | 
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Card** | Represents a single playing card (Rank, Suit, FaceUp/FaceDown state). |
| **Deck** | Represents standard 52 deck of playing cards. |
| **Hand** | Represents a single hand for a given round of Blackjack. | 

## Future Road Map (Project Management for more detail)
| **Milestone** | **Description** | 
|---------------|-----------------|
| **GameEngine** | Playable from Console Blackjack in `Java` |
| **Spring Boot** | Convert into a backend API | 
| **JS/HTML/CSS** | Build interface that calls the API. GUI in the browser | 
| **Interactive** | Style it & make interactive | 
| **Card Counting** | Implement a interactive card counting trainer |
