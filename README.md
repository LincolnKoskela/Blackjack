# Blackjack (Java)
This project will turn into more than just a fun game a blackjack. It'll teach you the best 
strategies to win at casinos. I'll also add a card counting simulator to turn any player into 
a card counting magician. I surely can't match the high intensity of sitting across from the dealer, 
all those cameras watching you, and mucho money on the line, through a virtual screen.  
However, I'll do my very best to replicate the environment to give the best possible experience, ultimately, 
turning the odds in our favor.
