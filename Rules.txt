Rules of blackjack

    Dealing

        Dealer starts with the first player on their left ("first base")
        Deals one card face up to each player around the table 
        Then deals one card to themselves face DOWN (hole card)

        Second Card goes around again, in the same direction 
        Second Card is face up to each player and to themselves

        Players always have two cards face up. 

    Spliting

        What does splitting mean

            If your first two cards are a pair(same rank), you can divide them into TWO seperate hands,
            placing an additional bet equal to your original bet.

                ex: 
                    You get 8S and 8C
                    Hand 1: 8S + (new card)
                    Hand 2: 8C + (new card)

        Core rules for splitting

            Must be the same rank, not value
            You must place an additional bet
                original bet stays on Hand1
                add an equal bet for Hand2
            Each split gets a new card

        Splitting Aces

            Most casinos only allow one card per Ace after splitting
            You cannot hit after recieving that one card
            Ace of Spade + one card, Ace of Clubs + one card -> both are frozen

            Note:
                A 10 on a split Ace counts as 21, not blackjack, so it pays 1:1, not 3:2

        Re-splitting Rules

            Typical US Rules

                You may re-split up to 3 times, making 4 hands max
                
                ex
                    8-8 -> split -> one 8 gets another 8 -> re-split

                Aces are usually not re-splittable

        Hitting and Doubling after Splitting 

            Hit

                Allowed on ALL split hands except Aces

            Double DOWN

                Allowed on split hands at many tables, but not universal
                Some casinos prohibit doubling after splitting 10s

            Split + Double 

                DAS = Double after Split
                If table says DAS is allowed, you can double on any split pair except Aces
